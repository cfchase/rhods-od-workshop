= 3.2 Exploring Kafka from Jupyter Notebooks

include::_attributes.adoc[]

Let's head back to the Jupyter notebook and explore Kafka, and ensure that the Kafka producers and consumers are working as expected. Just like before let's clone a git repo and bring in some sample code.

== Clone the Git Repository

* Select the root source directory to make sure you clone the git repository at the correct location.  To do this click on the folder icon in the displayed filepath in the file browser.

* On the left toolbar, click on the Git icon:

* Then click on *Clone a Repository*:

* Enter the Git *https* URL for the repository and click *Clone*:

* Select the newly created folder, `object-detection-kafka-consumer` and double click to browse.

== Explore the Notebooks

Now's you can try out Kafka in an interactive environment.  Two notebooks have been created for you to experiment with.  Feel free to check out the Kafka https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/[documentation] and the `kafka-python` https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/[docs].

* *1_kafka_consumer.ipynb* - A sample https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/apidoc/KafkaConsumer.html[consumer]. Start here and leave the last cell running while you try out the next notebook.

* *2_kafka_producer.ipynb* - A sample https://kafka-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/apidoc/KafkaProducer.html[producer].  Run this file to send messages you can consume.

* Back to *1_kafka_consumer.ipynb* - observe the messages consumed

* Stop the kernel in *both* notebooks.

== Exploring the Kafka Consumer App

In the next section, we'll turn our git repo into a new application.  Before we do, let's stop to examine the application files.

* Open the `prediction.py` file. What's interesting here is that there is NO difference from the rest service.  The data science prediction code did not change

* Open the `requirements.txt` file.  Again, the data science portion of the project as not changed.  What has changed is the application dependencies.  `flask` and `gunicorn` have been changed into our dependency for `kafka-python`.

* Open the `app.py` file.  This is the bulk of our change.  Our application code changed from the rest service in the `wsgi.py` to a basic Kafka consumer/producer.
