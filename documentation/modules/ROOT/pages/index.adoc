== Introduction

Welcome!

In this workshop, you'll learn an easy way to incorporate data science and AI/ML into an OpenShift development workflow.
As an example, you'll use an object detection model in several different ways.

You will:

* use Jupyter Notebooks to explore a pre-trained object detection model
* deploy the model using OpenShift Data Science model serving
* integrate the model into a real-time object detection app
* run offline scoring object detection pipelines
* refine and train the model

And all of this without having to install anything on your own computer, thanks to https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/openshift-data-science[Red Hat OpenShift Data Science].
