== Introduction

Welcome! In this workshop, you'll learn an easy way to incorporate data science and AI/ML into an OpenShift development workflow. As an example, you'll use an object detection model in several different ways. You will:

* Use Jupyter Notebooks and TensorFlow to explore a pre-trained object detection model
* Serve the model in a REST API as a Flask App
* Use source-to-image (s2i) to build and deploy the Flask App
* Explore Kafka streams from notebooks
* Deploy a Kafka consumer with the same object detection model

And all of this without having to install anything on your own computer, thanks to *Red Hat OpenShift Data Science* on the https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox[Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift, window="_blank"] and https://www.redhat.com/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/openshift-streams-for-apache-kafka[Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka]. 

== What is Red Hat OpenShift Data Science?

https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/openshift-data-science[Red Hat OpenShift Data Science] is a managed service that provides a complete data science platform on Red Hat OpenShift. It includes Jupyter Notebooks, JupyterLab, and a variety of data science libraries and frameworks. It also includes a catalog of pre-built models and templates to help you get started quickly.
