== The OpenShift Data Science Dashboard

include::_attributes.adoc[]

NOTE: We're going to refer to _Red Hat OpenShift Data Science_ as _RHODS_ throughout this workshop.

After logging into the OpenShift Web Console, you should see the OpenShift Data Science Dashboard as a tile in the top right-hand corner. You'll be prompted to log in to the OpenShift Data Science Dashboard using the Developer Sandbox authentication.

If you are prompted to log in using OpenShift, please go ahead and do so.  RHODS will use the same credentials as OpenShift for the dashboard, notebooks, and all other components.

At the OpenShift Data Science Dashboard, you can see the status of any installed and enabled applications as well as *Explore* other available application integrations.

== Navigating to the OCP console

You can navigate back to the OpenShift console in a similar fashion.  Simply click on the application switcher to access the OCP console.

For now, let's stay in the RHODS Dashboard.  Now that you are logged into to *Red Hat OpenShift Data Science*,  we can move on to creating a project.
