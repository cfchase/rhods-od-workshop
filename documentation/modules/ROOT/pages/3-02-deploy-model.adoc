= 2.2 Deploy the Model

include::_attributes.adoc[]

Now that the model is accessible in storage and saved in a portable `onnx` format, we can very easily use a RHODS model server to deploy it as an API.

We'll complete this workflow in the *RHODS Dashboard*.

== Create a Model Server

RHODS multi-model servers can host several models at once.  We'll create a new model server and deploy our model to it.

* In the *Models and model servers* list, click *Add server*.

In the form:

* Fill out the *Model server name*.  We named ours `Model Server`.

* Select `OpenVINO Model Server`.

* Leave other fields (replicas, size, route, auth) as the defaults.

== Deploy a Model

* In the *Models and model servers* list, next to your new model server, click *Deploy model*.

In the form:

* Fill out the *Model Name* with the value `yolo`.

* Select the server you created (`Model Server`).

* Select the *Existing data connection* `My Storage`

* Enter the path to your uploaded model, `models/yolov5n/model.onnx`

* Wait for the model to deploy and wait until the *Status* shows a green checkmark.

* Take note of the API Endpoint name and URL.  We'll use this in the next section.
