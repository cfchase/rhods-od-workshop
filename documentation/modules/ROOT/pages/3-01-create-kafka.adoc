= 3.1 Creating a Kafka Instance

include::_attributes.adoc[]

This section details creating a Kafka instance, Kafka topics, and connecting our application to stream data in a video form!

IMPORTANT: Due to Developer Sandbox limitations with support for Kafka, this will only work with a full dedicated OpenShift cluster.

== Introduction

Now that we have the model working on pictures, let's get this working with streaming data.  

A Kafka instance in OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka includes a Kafka cluster, bootstrap server, and the configurations needed to connect to producer and consumer services.  We'll be creating:

* Kafka Instance - record your *Bootstrap server*
* Service Account - record your *Client ID* and *Client Secret*
* Topics - record the names
** images
** objects
** notebook-test

== OpenShift Kafka Operator

We'll be creating this Kafka instance and related resources within our project, using the https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/amq-streams-datasheet[Kafka AMQ Streams Operator].  The Kafka AMQ Streams Operator is a Kubernetes Operator that manages Kafka instances deployed to OpenShift. To install the Kafka AMQ Streams Operator, head to the *Administrator*, then select *Operators* -> *Operators Hub* and search for *Kafka* to see the *AMQ Streams* Operator. Click *Install* to install the Kafka AMQ Streams Operator.

== Create a Kafka Instance

* Let's create our a Kafka instance. In the *Developer* perspective, select *+Add* -> *All Services* and search for *Kafka* to create a new Kafka instance.

* Enter a unique *Name* for the Kafka instance, such as `object-detection`, and click *Create instance*.

== Create Topics 

After you create a Kafka instance, you can create two Kafka topics to start producing and consuming messages in your services. From the *Developer* perspective, select *+Add* -> *All Services* and search for *Kafka Topic* to create a new Kafka topic. Repeat this process for these two topics.

* Create the `images` topic.  
** Topic name: `images` 
** Partitions: `1`
** Replicas: 3 _(default)_

* Create the `objects` topic.  
** Topic name: `objects`
** Partitions: `1`
** Replicas: 3 _(default)__

Great, your topics should have this same configuration (with the exception of the topic name):

When you're done, you should have three topics listed, `images`, `objects`, and `notebook-test`. You can view this by selecting the Web Terminal at the top-right of the OpenShift Console, and running the command `oc get kafkatopics`.
