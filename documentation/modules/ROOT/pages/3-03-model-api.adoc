= 2.3 Testing the Model API

include::_attributes.adoc[]

== API Requests

Now that we've deployed the model, we can look at the endpoints it created.

When creating the model server, we did *not* create a route for external access to the API and we did not protect it with an auth token.  This created an internal endpoint with no authentication. You found this information about the service and the model by hovering over the *Internal Service* and *?* identifiers for endpoint and model name in the previous section.  In the instructions, we named this model `yolo`

For this internal service, we can access it by communicating directly with the service the same way an application in your project would.  One of the easiest way to do test it out, is from a notebook in the same project.

Let's go back to the Jupyter environment and try out our new endpoint.
